- [x] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
      routing
      CRUD Operation
      build web application
      build restful web service(json)
      request,
      response

- [x] Describe Middleware?
      A function that is invoked by the Express routing layer before the final request handler, and thus sits in the middle between a raw request and the final intended route. -
      [x] Describe a Resource?
      Web applications were written in a client/server model where the client would demand resources from the server and the server would respond with the resources. The server only responded when the client requested and would close the connection after each response.

- [x] What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
      to help cients know if a request was successfully we give them a 200 response and a message of successfull
- [x] How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
      we can partition our application by using express Router
